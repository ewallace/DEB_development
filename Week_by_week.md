# Working document for what will be happening each week  


### Week 1: Introduction to biological research questions and real-world datasets.  
Short recorded lecture from each flavour lead about how data analysis is used in their field.
Recorded lecture on data sources and data protection
Class 1 - Outside exercise measuring tree diameters in small groups.  followed immediatley by inside 
    Entering data, basic plots, normality tests, t test, paired t test, P values
Class 2 - Downloading data, practice downloading and reading in data sets.
    reading in from excel, csv, delimitiers, missing values, headers, data types, non-data rows

Weekly quiz  topics: error, summary, signficant differences 

### Week 2: Data entry, filtering and formatting Data entry, cleaning and summarising.  
Short video on best practices for entering and organising data and the coding required to manage this.
Video will cover the 'introduction' - the very basics of manipulating dataframes. Class 3 will cover tidy data with some examples of re-formatting dataframes. Class 4 will be for the students to explore their own choice of dataset, I will work it up with the global agricultural darta.
Video introduction - re-shaping, finding errors.  Working through examples
    Transposing, correcting text errors, making new columns and rows, subsetting
Class 3 - tidy data, melt and pivot
Class 4 - Freer form practice

Weekly quiz topics: coding questions

### Week 3: Data visualisation 1  
Video will cover the 'introduction', class 1 will working through a guided example, class 2 will be for the students to explore their own choice of dataset
Short video on good and bad plots with examples from Andrew Hudson (and any other I can find)  
Class 5 Coding for producing a range of plot types, for data exploration.  ***Extra nugget - spatail plotting of data on maps? (if I can get it working...***)
Class 6 Practise with a choice of datasets

Weekly quiz topics: coding questions and plot interpretation

### Week 4: Combining and subsetting data (and website scraping)
Concat, merge and join.  subsetting by rows, columns and logical opperations.  Heirarchical structures.
Video covering principals of merging dataset - inner and outer merges, keys.
Class 7 Several examples of downloading and combining data
Class 8 Working with set questions from flavour leaders to download two datasets, combine them and plot a figure to answer a biological question.

Weekly quiz  
Mega quiz - coding  

### Week 5: Inferential statistics   
Classes 9 and 10 Teaching the principals of testing variation between groups.  Coding to run bootstrapping tests. Describing commonly used approaches (t-tests).  Dependant variables, Linear regression
Possibly mostly a reminder of Y1 work?
Weekly quiz  
Mega quiz - coding  

### Week 6: Multivariate analysis 1.  
Introduction to the concepts of multivariate statistics.  
Heatmaps, co-varience, standardisation, distance metrics, clustering (hiearchical, kmeans menetions but maybe not worked through?
Short ppt introduction
Class 11 Example notebook working through an example - RNASeq data on terpene biosynthetic genes
Class 12 Working with set questions from flavour leaders to produce a clustered heatmap to answer a biological question.
Weekly quiz

### Week 7: Multivariate analysis 2.  
PCA analysis.  Short ppt introduction
Class 13 Example notebook workign through an example (Brown trout genetics?)
Class 14 Working with set questions from flavour leaders to produce a clustered heatmap to answer a biological question.
Weekly quiz  

### Week 8: Starting work with the datasets  
Students pick a dataset to focus on (groups of 5) and in workshops led by each flavours lead develop a hypothesis which can be tested using their data exploration skills.  
Recorded lecture on hypothesis development and testing  
3 parallel workshops to develop plans for each group finishing with short presesntation  of each group's plans  
Weekly quiz  
Mega quiz - coding  

### Week 9: Principles of data presentation  
Coding and principles for communicating data to, for example, avoid misleading or difficult to interpret figures  
Recorded lecture on data presentation, examples of good and bad practise
Workshop developing posters  
Weekly quiz  

### Week 10: Poster day  
An event for students to display and present their posters, for assessment by staff and peers.  Will be accompanied by food and drinks at the Bayes Institute.  
Poster due in  
Portfolio due in
