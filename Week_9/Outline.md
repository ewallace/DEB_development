### Video and notebook on key principals with good and bad examples.

Edward Tufte

“Above all else, show the data.” 


“There are two goals when presenting data: convey your story and establish credibility.” 


Tell the truth
Tailor presentation to the audience
Choose the right graph
Emphasise important points
Form follows function


The right chart enhances information, the wrong one conceals insights.

Omit the insignificant to highlight the essential.

Everything on the chart should be there for a reason and essential to conveying the meassage.  
Do you need all the tick labels, lines etc... are the colours helping or hindering?
Titles should be informative! NOT "results of the analysis"
