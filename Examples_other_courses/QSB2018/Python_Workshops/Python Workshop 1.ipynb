    "#### Marking \n",

There is a 'check' button on each CodeRunner question that checks whether the answer is correct and notifies you of the result in a box beside the question number. Each push of the 'Check' button counts as an attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you see in a question \"Penalty Scheme: 0,0,0,10,20,30...\", that means that no penalties will be applied for the first three times you submit your answer (by pushing the 'check' button) and that 10% will be deducted from your maximum final mark for each try thereafter. For example, if you get the answer right on the 4th time you submit your answer, you will receive 90% of the available marks for that answer.\n",
    "\n",
