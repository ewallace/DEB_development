    "Welcome to Workshop 2. This workshop is based on all of the material covered in the self-study notebooks up to the end of notebook 11. You will now have learned about loops, dictionaries, conditional statements and loops so you now have the basic toolset to write programs capable of performing complex and repetitive tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will **work in groups of 2-3 students** to solve a series of problems in two Jupyter notebooks. If you complete those within the workshop, you may want to try the (optional) notebook 'Workshop 2c' - you may need some demonstrator help with that one. \n",

    "* Think about what the question is asking you to do - how can you break it down into computable components that you can write in Python. What is your input, and what output do you need? Does you program need to use loops? Does it need to make decisions (conditional statements)?\n",
    "* Do you need to store data? What data structures (e.g. lists and dictionaries) would make your task easiest?\n",

Even very proficient programmers make frequent use of Google searches or Python documentation. You should get into the habit of looking up code syntax you want to know more about or Googling how to achieve a particular task with code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a skill - try to use accurate programming language in your searches - you're more likely to get a good hit with \"How do I generate a random integer in Python\" than \"How do I pick a number between 0 and 100\". \n",

    "\n",
    "The meaning of palindrome in the context of molecular biology is slightly different from the definition used for words and sentences. Since a double helix is formed by two paired strands of nucleotides that run in opposite directions in the 5'-to-3' sense, and the nucleotides always pair in the same way (Adenine (A) with Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) with Guanine (G)), a (single-stranded) nucleotide sequence is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse complement. \n",
    "\n",
    "To state that another way, if you substitute each nucleotide in a palindrome with its partner and reverse the sequence (this is known as reverse complementing), it will be the same as the original sequence. \n",

    "For example, the DNA sequence ATGATCAT is palindromic because its nucleotide-by-nucleotide complement is TACTAGTA, and reversing the order of the nucleotides in the complement gives the original sequence.\n",

    "Most restriction enzyme (enzymes that cut at a specific DNA sequence and are widely used for DNA modification and cloning) cleavage sites are palindromic. \n",

    "* Part 1 - You are given a DNA sequence in a variable called sequence. Write a program to test whether the DNA sequence is a palindrome, and return 'True' or 'False'. You might find the dictionary 'pairs' useful in helping you complement the DNA sequence.\n",
