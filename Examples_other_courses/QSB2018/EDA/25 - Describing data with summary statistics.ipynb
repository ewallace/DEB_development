The **spread** tells us how variable the measurements are from individual to individual - how widely scattered the observations are around the centre. \n",

    "The importance of describing distribution **spread** is less obvious but no less crucial, at least in biology. In some fields of science, variability around a central value is instrument noise or measurement error, but in biology much of the variability signifies real differences among individuals. Different individuals respond differently to treatments, and this variability begs measurement. Measuring variability also gives us perspective. We can ask, \"How large are the differences between groups compared with variations within groups?\" Biologists also appreciate variation as the stuff of evolution - we wouldnâ€™t be here without variation.\n",
