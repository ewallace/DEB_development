Each observation is represented as a point on a graph with two axes. The explanatory variable is on the $x$-axis and the response variable is on the $y$-axis. The pattern in the resulting cloud of points indicates whether a correlation between the two variables is positive (in which case the points tend to run from the lower left to the upper right of the graph), negative (the points run from the upper left to the lower right), or absent (no discernible pattern)."

The relationship between brain-to-body mass ratio and complexity of behaviour is not perfect as other factors also influence intelligence, like the evolution of the recent cerebral cortex and different degrees of brain folding, which increase the surface of the cortex, which is positively correlated in humans to intelligence.\n",
