    "\n",
    "The human eye is a natural pattern detector, adept at spotting trends and exceptions in visual displays. For this reason, biologists spend hours creating and examining visual summaries of their data - graphs and, to a lesser extent, tables. Effective graphs enable visual comparisons of measurements between groups, and they expose relationships between different variables. They are also the principal means of communicating results to a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Florence Nightingale (1858) was one of the ﬁrst persons to put graphs to good use. \n",
    "![](images/night.jpg)\n",
    "In her famous wedge diagrams, redrawn in the ﬁgure above, she visualised the causes of death of British troops during the Crimean War. The number of cases is indicated by the area of a wedge, and the cause of death by colour. The diagrams showed convincingly that disease was the main cause of soldier deaths during the wars, not wounds or other causes. With these vivid graphs, she successfully campaigned for military and public health measures that saved many lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective graphs are a prerequisite for good data analysis, revealing general patterns in the data that bare numbers cannot. Therefore, the first step in any data analysis is to graph the data and look at it. Humans are a visual species, with brains evolved to process visual information. Take advantage of millions of years of evolution, and look at visual representations of your data before doing anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are vital tools for analysing data. They are also used to communicate patterns in data to a wider audience in the form of reports, slide shows, and web content. The two purposes, analysis and presentation, are largely coincident because the most revealing displays will be the best both for identifying patterns in the data and for communicating these patterns to others. Both purposes require displays that are clear, honest, and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next few notebooks we will look at how different types of datasets are commonly displayed in tables and graphs. The types of datasets we will look at are:\n",
    "* A single numerical variable\n",
    "* A single categorical variable\n",
