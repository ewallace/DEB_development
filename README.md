#### Developing a data exploration course for second year

This course aims to give students the skills to work with biological datasets to present, summarise and explore patterns in a wide range of datasets using python, pandas and seaborn.

We will take the student through guided examples, supported exploration and to independant work.

#### The basic structure is:
Video introduction to work of the week explaining what will happen and guiding student through a notebook presenting the basics, using toy datasets.

Class 1: Notebooks to be worked through in workshops with structured examples.  Background for examples given so relevance is clear.  Biological questions posed and answered.

Class 2: Students can pick a dataset to work with and develop their skills.  A selection of real datasets are provided by flavour leaders along with a question to answer.
