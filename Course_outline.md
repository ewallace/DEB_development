### Course Outline

Weeks 1-6 to focus on developing skills using toy data sets and prehaps a range of examples from the flavour datasets.  Weeks 7,8,9 to focus on usinghte dataset to test a hypothesis.  

Week 1: Introduction to biological research questions and real-world datasets.  
Individual classes on the different flavours with biological background provided by the staff member leading each dataset   

Week 2: Data entry, filtering and formatting Data entry, cleaning and summarising.   
Students will be taught best practices for entering and organising data and the coding required to manage this  

Week 3: Data visualisation  
How to choose appropriate visualisations for different data types.  Coding for producing a range of plot types, for data exploration.  

Week 4: Combining data 
Adding new data, merging dataframes, subsetting dataframes

Week 5: Inferential statistics   
Teaching the principals of testing variation between groups.  Coding to run bootstrapping tests. Describing commonly used approaches (t-tests).  

Week 6: Multivariate analysis 1.  
Introduction to the concepts of multivariate statistics.  

Week 7: Multivariate analysis 2.   
How to visualise and interpret multivariate relationships in Python.  Using examples to provide a framework.  

Week 8: Putting the results in biological context – more on the system  
Interactive session where student groups are able to discuss with staff in charge of each dataset outcomes of their investigations.  Including a presentation from the “dataset coordinator” about the data and the advanced or wider implications/applications of the datasets  

Week 9: Principles of data presentation  
Coding and principles for communicating data to, for example, avoid misleading or difficult to interpret figures  

Week 10: Poster day  
An event for students to display and present their posters, for assessment by staff and peers.  Will be accompanied by food and drinks at the Bayes Institute.  


### Assessment
