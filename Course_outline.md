### Course Outline

Weeks 1-6 to focus on developing skills using toy data sets and prehaps a range of examples from the flavour datasets.  Weeks 7,8,9 to focus on using the dataset to test a hypothesis.  

Week 1: Introduction to biological research questions and real-world datasets.  
Entering data and quick stats/visualiation - revison of first year, then more detail on data downloading, reading is different file types and formatting

Week 2: Tidy data. Re-arranging and managing data.

Week 3: Data visualisation  
How to choose appropriate visualisations for different data types.  Coding for producing a range of plot types, for data exploration.  

Week 4: Introduction to the flavour datasets, hypothesis development and testing
session where student groups are able to discuss with staff in charge of each dataset outcomes of their investigations.  Including a presentation from the “dataset coordinator” about the data and the advanced or wider implications/applications of the datasets 

Week 5: Combining data  
Different types of joins.  First workshop workign with the chosen data set
