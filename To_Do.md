### Find best way to run warm up quizzes
    Wooclap - have signed up, need to test

### Check set up for notebooks 
    Meeting with James Stix Wed 10th

### Look through other examples of courses

#### Notebooks testing
 Polish notebooks - adding more for students to do and explore
 See how the notebooks run on Noteable
 Test the course on potential demonstrators (RBGE students adn others?)

#### More examples
Add more small data analysis examples from papers
Add pop gen clustering for week 8? (week 8 is pop genetics genes and evolution course
Add phlyogenetic drawing example as an extra to week 10/11)?  https://github.com/taylor-lindsay/phylogenetics/blob/master/turtles/turtles.ipynb
Add spatail plotting as an extra?
    
#### Assessement. 
Need to establish marking rubric for poster and guidelines for the analysis.  
(Do we assess the notebooks used to generate the figures?). 
Need to add short coding problems (warm-ups?) to the beginning of each workshop.  
Need to decide on longer data analysis problems for individual work (weeks 1-5, 5-9) and class test (week 11) 

#### Learn site
Set up, need to populate....
Need to add in all course team members.
When to transfer course from github?
