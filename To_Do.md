### Divide up production of videos and notebooks
Resources needed:
    Video to go over pricipals and illustrate the commands.
    Notebook to work through in first class of week
    Outline of work for second class of week, where students produce their own notebooks
    Class notebooks all via discussion with Nick and Chris as Workshop leads.
