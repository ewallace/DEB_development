### Content needed
    Short talks from Edward, Iain and Catherine on using data in their work
    
    Class1 re-vamp - gathering data in the classroom.  Head diameter.  WORKING ON
    Group designations - before first class?  Would be good to have them sticking in groups throughout.
    How to report av diameters and marks on coding problem?  Just ask round class?
    Get group name and av diamter, coding answers submitted via ??? under group name

    Need a short revisionary quiz for session one. Topics?
    Command line navigation


    Class 2
    Checked all ran.  Year column can only be called by location not name!!!
    Move joinig df to the next class

    Week 2 Class 3 All good, too long?.  Need a  'warm up'  quiz

    Class 4 Need to add a 'playing with set' and short quiz.

    Week 3 Class 5 all good

    Class 6 need to add a warm up quiz

    Week 4Class 7 Need to book 3 parallel rooms for biology talks

    Class 8 Back to group work 

    Week5 Class 9 Need warm up Quiz

        Class 10 - Group work

### Check set up for notebooks 
    Catherine to discuss with Nick and Graeme and enlist a BTO contact who knows the set up.

### Look through other examples of courses
    See files uploaded by Graeme
    Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's course (she's left now)
        https://datasciencebox.org/
    Charlotte Desvages MSc intro course
         https://github.com/pypr-2122/table-of-contents/

#### Need to:
 Check teaching space - will need 3 parallel session in Week 4
 Polish notebooks
 See how the notebooks run on Noteable
 Test the course on potential demonstrators

### Divide up production of teaching material
Resources needed:  
    ppt to go over principals and illustrate the commands.  
    Notebook to work through in first class of week. 
    Outline of work for second class of week, where students produce their own notebooks.  
    Class notebooks all via discussion with Nick and Chris as Workshop leads.  
    
#### Assessement. 
Need to establish marking rubric for poster and guidelines for the analysis.  
(Do we assess the notebooks used to generate the figures?). 
Need to add short coding problems (warm-ups?) to the beginning of each workshop.  
Need to decide on longer coding problems for individual assessment?
